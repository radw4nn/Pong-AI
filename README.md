# Ping Pong AI using NEAT Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of a Ping Pong AI system that utilizes the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) genetic algorithm for training the model. The Ping Pong AI is designed to learn and improve its gameplay strategy through evolutionary processes, mimicking natural selection and genetic variation.

## Features

- **NEAT Genetic Algorithm:** The core of the Ping Pong AI system is the NEAT algorithm, which evolves neural networks to learn and adapt to gameplay conditions over time.
  
- **Game Environment:** Provides a simulated Ping Pong game environment where the AI agent can interact and learn by playing against opponents.

- **Training Interface:** Includes a user-friendly interface for setting up training parameters, monitoring training progress, and visualizing gameplay.

- **Configurability:** Allows customization of various parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and neural network architecture to experiment with different training settings.
