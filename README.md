# Ping Pong AI using NEAT Genetic Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of a Ping Pong AI system that utilizes the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) genetic algorithm for training the model. The Ping Pong AI is designed to learn and improve its gameplay strategy through evolutionary processes, mimicking natural selection and genetic variation.

## Features

- **NEAT Genetic Algorithm:** The core of the Ping Pong AI system is the NEAT algorithm, which evolves neural networks to learn and adapt to gameplay conditions over time.
  
- **Game Environment:** Provides a simulated Ping Pong game environment where the AI agent can interact and learn by playing against opponents.

- **Training Interface:** Includes a user-friendly interface for setting up training parameters, monitoring training progress, and visualizing gameplay.

- **Configurability:** Allows customization of various parameters such as population size, mutation rates, and neural network architecture to experiment with different training settings.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/your_username/ping-pong-ai.git`
  `cd ping-pong-ai`
2. Install dependencies:
  `pip install neat_python`
3. Run the training script

## Usage

1. Configure training parameters in the `config.txt` file to adjust the NEAT algorithm settings, game environment parameters, and other options.
2. Run the training script to start the evolutionary process.
3. Monitor training progress, evaluate performance metrics, and visualize gameplay through the training interface.
4. Once training is complete, the trained Ping Pong AI model can be saved and deployed for gameplay or further analysis.
